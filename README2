Start this as a root user since it uses the privileged port 23 (telnet).  
It only simulates the port reset functionality.  Login and password aren't
actually authenticated... they just match what you would see when logging 
into an actual Digi.

I will add it to the /etc/init.d/rc2.d directory so that it starts on boot.

Current config:
Simulated Digi interface: telnet localhost 23
ser2net interface: telnet localhost 2000
